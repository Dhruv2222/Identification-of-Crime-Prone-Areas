## Problem Definition:
Emergencies can be of different kinds, from fires to road accidents and assaults, to medical emergencies. It is distressing to be faced with an unanticipated incident or emergency. In our country, 112 is the single emergency number, people in distress can call to get immediate assistance – from fire brigade, medical team or from the police. Law enforcement officials across the country would find it incredibly useful if they had an automated system to continually identify areas that are more prone to crimes and policing-related incidents, than others. This would allow them to proactively review and plan suitable resource deployments and patrolling in those areas, and thereby preempt and prevent, as far as possible, untoward incidents that could result in an emergency.
Through this project we aim to utilize the power of Machine Learning to tackle the increasing criminal activity in the society. We can identify the crime prone areas by analyzing the historic data from emergency services and the current data from sources like Twitter and News feeds. Further, we aim to build a solution for policing that is able to filter out crimes based on the type of crime as well as the location. This will enable officials to reduce the crime by taking actions which will be specific to the crimes in each location. It will also help people to know which area is safe for them to visit.

## Motivation:
Crime rate is increasing day by day and even though crimes can occur anywhere, they are more in some places than others. When selecting a neighborhood to move to, crime rate

is one of the important factors people consider. For authorities too, knowing the high crime rate areas is crucial to ensure the community’s safety. Hence, the identification of crime prone areas will not only benefit the citizens but also the authorities to make better and informed decisions. The authorities can analyze the high crime prone areas using different filters such as location and crime type. This will enable them to take necessary actions in that location. Officials can even impose appropriate rules and resources in locations more prone to crimes in order to prevent it from occurring in future.
The system will also be available to citizens so that they can see the crime prone areas and select the appropriate locations to buy a new house, choose school for their children or even plan their trip. Having necessary information related to crimes about a location will empower people to be alert and in turn save themselves from criminal activities. The advantages of such kind of system motivated us to go ahead with this idea.

## Scope of the project:
The scope of this project mainly includes analysis of crime data from 3 different data sources. The data sources used in this project are as follows:
1. New York Police Department Historic Crime Data
2. Twitter data from New York crime Twitter handles
3. News feeds
Three data sources have been used since the first data source, NYPD Historic Crime Data provides data about the past crimes while the other two data sources provide data about the recent crimes. The main objective of this project is to make the public as well as police personnel aware about the areas where maximum crime occurs and to give other related statistics about that region. Using this information, the police could allot resources accordingly. We also aim to display the results in visuals formats making it simpler for the users to interpret the data. Features such as ‘filter by crime type’ and ‘filter by location’ help the users to narrow down their search queries.

## Organization of the report:
The report starts by displaying the certificates and declarations which gives a gist of the project which will be explained in detail ahead. Then comes the introduction section, i.e. Chapter 1, which explains the problem definition, motivation behind the project, scope of the project, salient contribution and organization of report. Then the research done for this project and the concepts learned are explained in short in the section Literature Survey which forms the Chapter 2 of this report. Chapter 3 emphasizes on the Software Project Management Plan which contains the project planning in detail. It would have details about project objectives, project estimates, project schedules, project resources, project staffing, risk management plans, project monitoring, project control and other miscellaneous activities. Next, requirements, expectations, and standards for the project are described in Chapter 4. A detailed plan of how to develop a piece of software is discussed in Chapter 5 of Software Design Document. In Chapter 6, Implementation explains the technologies used, algorithm or the methodology used in this project and the sample images taken which show how to use this system. Chapter 7, The Software Test Document(STD) describes the test preparations, test cases, and test procedures to be used to perform qualification testing of the Computer Software. Conclusion explains what we are concluding from the results we obtained and scope for future work on this project, which is written in Chapter 8 of this thesis. At the end of this thesis, the references used to develop this system are mentioned along with Appendix A, Author’s Publication and Acknowledgments.
Hence, the general idea of the project is portrayed by discussing the motivation behind this topic and the scope of this topic. Next, the background work or the literature survey done before and during the implementation of this project is stated in the next chapter.
